description: Best known for her novel The awakening, Kate Chopin (1851-1904) established
  her literary reputation with short stories about life in rural Louisiana during
  the late nineteenth century. After her 1870 marriage to Oscar Chopin, a Creole cotton
  trader and commission merchant, she lived in and around New Orleans for more than
  a decade until her husband's death in 1882. During these years, Chopin became acquainted
  with Creoles, Cajuns, and newly freed blacks. When Oscar Chopin died he was nearly
  bankrupt, forcing Kate and their six children to return to her family in St. Louis.
  Still under the spell of New Orleans, Chopin began writing and her short stories
  about Creole and Cajun life first appeared in magazines in 1889. The stories collected
  in Bayou folk (1894) present remarkably vivid snapshots of daily life in a now vanished
  world. Many of them highlight the relations between blacks and whites in a society
  where the rules of engagement still reflected the entrenched patterns of slavery
  some two decades after the Civil War.
